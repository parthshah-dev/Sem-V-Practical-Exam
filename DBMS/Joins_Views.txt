1. Create Sample Tables
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    CourseID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 101);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 'Sneha', 102);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (3, 'Amit', 101);
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (101, 'Computer Science');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (102, 'Information Tech');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (103, 'Electronics');

2. Types of JOINS
a) INNER JOIN

Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

b) LEFT JOIN

Returns all students and their course names, even if no course matches.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
LEFT JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

c) RIGHT JOIN

Returns all courses, even if no student has taken that course.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
RIGHT JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

d) FULL JOIN

Returns all records when there is a match in either table (not supported in all SQL systems, but conceptually):

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
FULL OUTER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

3. Subquery Example

Find students enrolled in the same course as “Sneha”:

SELECT Name 
FROM Student
WHERE CourseID = (
    SELECT CourseID 
    FROM Student 
    WHERE Name = 'Sneha'
);

4. VIEW Example

Create a view showing student names with their course names.

CREATE VIEW StudentCourseView AS
SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;


To see data from the view:

SELECT * FROM StudentCourseView;
