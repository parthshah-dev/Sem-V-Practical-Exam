1. Create Sample Tables
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    CourseID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 101);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 'Sneha', 102);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (3, 'Amit', 101);
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (101, 'Computer Science');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (102, 'Information Tech');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (103, 'Electronics');

2. Types of JOINS
a) INNER JOIN

Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

b) LEFT JOIN

Returns all students and their course names, even if no course matches.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
LEFT JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

c) RIGHT JOIN

Returns all courses, even if no student has taken that course.

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
RIGHT JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

d) FULL JOIN

Returns all records when there is a match in either table (not supported in all SQL systems, but conceptually):

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
FULL OUTER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;

3. Subquery Example

Find students enrolled in the same course as “Sneha”:

SELECT Name 
FROM Student
WHERE CourseID = (
    SELECT CourseID 
    FROM Student 
    WHERE Name = 'Sneha'
);

4. VIEW Example

Create a view showing student names with their course names.

CREATE VIEW StudentCourseView AS
SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Course
ON Student.CourseID = Course.CourseID;


To see data from the view:

SELECT * FROM StudentCourseView;



Theory: SQL Joins, Subqueries, and Views

This program demonstrates how Joins, Subqueries, and Views are used in SQL to retrieve and manage related data efficiently from multiple tables.

1. Joins

A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

    - INNER JOIN:
        Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It is the most common type of join.

    - LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):
        Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the right table show as NULL.

    - RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
        Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. Unmatched rows from the left table show as NULL.

    - FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN):
        Returns all records from both tables, with NULL in places where there is no match. (Some databases like MySQL may not support it directly.)

These joins help in retrieving related data across multiple tables such as student names with their respective course names.

2. Subquery

A subquery is a query written inside another query. It allows data to be retrieved conditionally, based on the result of another query.

Subqueries are often used for comparisons, filtering data, or performing operations like finding maximum, minimum, or matching records across related tables

3. View

A view is a virtual table created using a SQL query. It does not store data physically but displays data from one or more tables.
The CREATE VIEW statement defines a view, and it can be queried like a normal table.

Views simplify complex queries, improve security by restricting direct table access, and help in reusing frequently used queries.
