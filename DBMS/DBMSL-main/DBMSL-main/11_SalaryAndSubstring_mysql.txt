Question:
Collection schema (Perform on MySQL Terminal)
student(S_ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred)
instructor(T_ID, name, dept_name, salary)
course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
i. Find the average salary of instructor in those departments where the average salary is more than Rs. 42000/-
ii. Increase the salary of each instructor in the computer department by 10%
iii. Find the names of instructors whose names are neither ‘Amol’ nor ‘Amit’
iv. Find the names of students which contains ‘am’ as its substring
v. Find the name of students from computer department that “DBMS” courses they take

=============== Answer =======================
Step 1: Start MySQL Terminal
mysql -u root -p
sudo mysql

Step 2: Create Database and Use
CREATE DATABASE university;
USE university;

Step 3: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE student(
    S_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    tot_cred INT
);

CREATE TABLE instructor(
    T_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE course(
    course_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    credits INT
);

Step 4: Insert Sample Data (Multi-record)
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES
(101, 'Amol', 'CSE', 50000),
(102, 'Amit', 'IT', 45000),
(103, 'Dr. Mary', 'CSE', 55000),
(104, 'Dr. John', 'IT', 40000);

INSERT INTO student VALUES
(1, 'Sam', 'CSE', 120),
(2, 'Ramesh', 'CSE', 100),
(3, 'Aman', 'IT', 110),
(4, 'Priya', 'CSE', 130);

INSERT INTO course VALUES
(201, 'DBMS', 'CSE', 4),
(202, 'OS', 'CSE', 3),
(203, 'Networks', 'IT', 3);

Query Execution and Answers
i. Average salary in departments where avg > 42000
SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING AVG(salary) > 42000;

ii. Increase salary of each instructor in computer department by 10%
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE dept_name = 'CSE';

iii. Names of instructors whose names are neither 'Amol' nor 'Amit'
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE name NOT IN ('Amol', 'Amit');

iv. Names of students containing 'am' as substring
SELECT name
FROM student
WHERE name LIKE '%am%';

v. Names of students from computer department taking DBMS
SELECT s.name
FROM student s
JOIN course c ON s.dept_name = c.dept_name
WHERE c.title = 'DBMS';

Theory
What is MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database system that stores structured data in tables and enables data manipulation and retrieval using SQL queries.

Practical Related Concepts
1. Aggregate Functions with HAVING:
AVG(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX() calculate summary statistics.
HAVING filters grouped results.
Syntax:
SELECT column, AVG(column2) FROM table GROUP BY column HAVING AVG(column2) > value;

2. UPDATE with Arithmetic:
Modify numeric fields with calculations, e.g., increment by 10%.
Syntax:
UPDATE table SET column = column * 1.10 WHERE condition;

3. NOT IN Clause:
Filters out multiple unwanted values.
Syntax:
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column NOT IN (value1, value2);

4. LIKE Operator with Wildcards:
% matches any sequence of characters.
_ matches a single character.
Syntax:
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%substring%';

5. JOIN Operation:
Combines data from two tables based on a related column.
Syntax:
SELECT columns FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

(
Explanation
Aggregate with HAVING allows filtering departments where average salary exceeds 42000.
UPDATE with arithmetic increases salaries efficiently.
NOT IN excludes specific instructor names.
LIKE helps find substrings in student names.
JOIN connects students to courses to identify which students take DBMS in their department.
This practical demonstrates aggregation, arithmetic updates, filtering, pattern matching, and table joins in MySQL.
