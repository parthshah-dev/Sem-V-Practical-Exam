Question:
Collection “movies” which contains the documents given as below (Perform on Mongo Terminal)
{
  name: "Movie1",
  type: "action",
  budget: 1000000,
  producer: {
    name: "producer1",
    address: "PUNE"
  }
}
i. Find the name of the movie having budget greater than 1,00,000.
ii. Find the name of producer who lives in Pune.
iii. Update the type of movie “action” to “horror”.
iv. Find all the documents produced by name “producer1” with their address.

====== Answer (MongoDB Commands):
# Open Mongo Shell
mongosh
# Create and use database
use moviedb
# Insert sample documents
db.movies.insertMany([
  { name: "Movie1", type: "action", budget: 1000000, producer: { name: "producer1", address: "PUNE" } },
  { name: "Movie2", type: "romance", budget: 80000, producer: { name: "producer2", address: "MUMBAI" } },
  { name: "Movie3", type: "action", budget: 250000, producer: { name: "producer1", address: "PUNE" } }
])

i. Find the name of the movie having budget greater than 1,00,000
db.movies.find({ budget: { $gt: 100000 } }, { name: 1, _id: 0 })

ii. Find the name of producer who lives in Pune
db.movies.find({ "producer.address": "PUNE" }, { "producer.name": 1, _id: 0 })

iii. Update the type of movie “action” to “horror”
db.movies.updateMany(
  { type: "action" },
  { $set: { type: "horror" } }
)

iv. Find all the documents produced by name “producer1” with their address
db.movies.find(
  { "producer.name": "producer1" },
  { name: 1, "producer.address": 1, _id: 0 }
)

Theory
What is MongoDB:
MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible BSON (Binary JSON) format. It allows high performance, scalability, and easy handling of unstructured or semi-structured data using collections instead of tables.

Querying and Updating in MongoDB:
MongoDB provides a powerful query language to search and modify documents. Query selectors help filter data based on conditions, while update operators modify specific fields within matched documents.
Syntax:
Find Documents:
db.collection.find({ condition })
Update Documents:
db.collection.update({ condition }, { $set: { field: value } })

Concepts Used
1. Query Selector ($gt):
Used to match documents where the field value is greater than the specified value.
Syntax: { field: { $gt: value } }

2. Dot Notation:
Used to access fields inside embedded documents such as nested objects.
Syntax: { "embeddedDocument.field": value }

3. Update Operator ($set):
Used to modify or add new values to existing fields within documents.
Syntax: { $set: { field: value } }

4. Projection:
Determines which fields to include or exclude in the query results.
Syntax: db.collection.find({ condition }, { field: 1, _id: 0 })

5. find() Method:
Retrieves documents that match specific query conditions.
Syntax: db.collection.find({ condition })

6. update() Method:
Modifies one or more documents that meet a given condition using update operators.
Syntax: db.collection.update({ condition }, { $set: { field: value } })
