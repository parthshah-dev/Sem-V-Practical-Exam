Question:
Collection schema (Perform on MySQL Terminal)
teaches(T_ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
section(course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_no)
instructor(T_ID, name, dept_name, salary)
course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
i. Display the name of the instructor whose salary is between 30000 and 60000 in descending order.
ii. Find the average, minimum, maximum salary in each department.
iii. Display the name of the instructor, his department name, and salary who teaches the course_id: 101.
iv. Find the name of the instructor whose average salary is greater than 60000.

================= Answer====================
Step 1: Start MySQL Terminal
mysql -u root -p
sudo mysql

Step 2: Create Database and Use
CREATE DATABASE university;
USE university;

Step 3: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE teaches(
    T_ID INT,
    course_id INT,
    sec_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(10),
    year YEAR
);

CREATE TABLE section(
    course_id INT,
    sec_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(10),
    year YEAR,
    building VARCHAR(50),
    room_no INT
);

CREATE TABLE instructor(
    T_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE course(
    course_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    credits INT
);

Step 4: Insert Sample Data (Multi-record)
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES
(101, 'Dr. Smith', 'CSE', 50000),
(102, 'Dr. John', 'IT', 45000),
(103, 'Dr. Mary', 'CSE', 30000),
(104, 'Dr. Alex', 'ECE', 25000),
(105, 'Dr. Jane', 'CSE', 65000);

INSERT INTO course VALUES
(101, 'DBMS', 'CSE', 4),
(102, 'OS', 'CSE', 3),
(103, 'Networks', 'IT', 3);

INSERT INTO teaches VALUES
(101, 101, 1, 'Fall', 2023),
(102, 102, 1, 'Spring', 2023),
(103, 103, 1, 'Fall', 2023);

INSERT INTO section VALUES
(101, 1, 'Fall', 2023, 'Bldg-A', 101),
(102, 1, 'Spring', 2023, 'Bldg-B', 102),
(103, 1, 'Fall', 2023, 'Bldg-C', 103);

Query Execution and Answers
i. Display instructors whose salary is between 30000 and 60000 in descending order
SELECT name, salary
FROM instructor
WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000
ORDER BY salary DESC;

ii. Find average, minimum, maximum salary in each department
SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name;

iii. Display name, department, salary of instructor who teaches course_id 101
SELECT i.name, i.dept_name, i.salary
FROM instructor i
JOIN teaches t ON i.T_ID = t.T_ID
WHERE t.course_id = 101;

iv. Find name of instructor whose average salary is greater than 60000
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > 60000;

Theory
What is MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store structured data in tables and perform operations using SQL queries.

Practical Related Concepts
1. Range Query using BETWEEN:
Filters records whose values lie between two specified values.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

2. Aggregate Functions:
Functions to compute summary statistics:
AVG() → Average
MIN() → Minimum
MAX() → Maximum
Syntax:
SELECT AVG(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary) FROM table GROUP BY column;

3. JOIN Operation:
Combines data from multiple tables based on a related column.
Syntax:
SELECT columns FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

4. ORDER BY Clause:
Sorts results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
Syntax:
SELECT columns FROM table ORDER BY column DESC;

5. Filtering on Single Condition:
Retrieves rows satisfying a specific condition.
Syntax:
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column > value;

6. Grouping (GROUP BY):
Groups rows sharing the same value of one or more columns for aggregation.
Syntax:
SELECT column, AGG_FUNC(column2) FROM table GROUP BY column;

Explanation
Range query (BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000) filters instructors by salary efficiently.
Aggregate functions compute summary statistics like average, minimum, and maximum salary per department.
JOIN retrieves instructor details for a particular course.
ORDER BY DESC displays results in descending order, showing highest-paid first.
Filtering for salary > 60000 identifies instructors exceeding a threshold.
This practical demonstrates range queries, aggregation, joins, sorting, and filtering — core SQL operations for structured data management in MySQL.
