Question:
Collection schema (Perform on MySQL Terminal)
teaches(T_ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
student(S_ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred)
instructor(T_ID, name, dept_name, salary)
course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
i. Find the total number of instructors who teach a course in the First semester 2010.
ii. Find the names of all instructors from computer department whose name includes the substring ‘shree’.
iii. Find the names of all instructors that have a salary greater than the average salary of the Civil Department.
iv. Find the set of all courses taught either in Fifth semester 2014 or in First semester 2010 or both.

================ Answer ===================
Step 1: Start MySQL Terminal
mysql -u root -p
sudo mysql

Step 2: Create Database and Use
CREATE DATABASE university;
USE university;

Step 3: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE teaches(
    T_ID INT,
    course_id INT,
    sec_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(10),
    year YEAR
);

CREATE TABLE student(
    S_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    tot_cred INT
);

CREATE TABLE instructor(
    T_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE course(
    course_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    credits INT
);

Step 4: Insert Sample Data (Multi-record)
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES
(101, 'Dr. Shree Kumar', 'CSE', 50000),
(102, 'Dr. Amol', 'CSE', 45000),
(103, 'Dr. Shree Mary', 'IT', 55000),
(104, 'Dr. John', 'Civil', 60000),
(105, 'Dr. Alex', 'Civil', 40000);

INSERT INTO course VALUES
(201, 'DBMS', 'CSE', 4),
(202, 'OS', 'CSE', 3),
(203, 'Networks', 'IT', 3),
(204, 'Structures', 'Civil', 4);

INSERT INTO teaches VALUES
(101, 201, 1, 'First', 2010),
(102, 202, 1, 'First', 2010),
(103, 203, 1, 'Fifth', 2014),
(104, 204, 1, 'First', 2010),
(105, 204, 1, 'Fifth', 2014);

Query Execution and Answers
i. Total number of instructors teaching in First semester 2010
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T_ID) AS total_instructors
FROM teaches
WHERE semester = 'First' AND year = 2010;

ii. Names of instructors from computer department including 'shree'
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'CSE' AND name LIKE '%shree%';

iii. Names of instructors with salary greater than Civil department average
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM instructor
    WHERE dept_name = 'Civil'
);

iv. Set of all courses taught either in Fifth semester 2014 or First semester 2010 or both
SELECT DISTINCT course_id
FROM teaches
WHERE (semester = 'Fifth' AND year = 2014) 
   OR (semester = 'First' AND year = 2010);

Theory 
What is MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database system for managing structured data using SQL queries for storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Practical Related Concepts
1. COUNT and DISTINCT:
COUNT() counts rows.
DISTINCT removes duplicates from results.
Syntax:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column) FROM table WHERE condition;

2. LIKE with Wildcards:
% matches any sequence of characters.
_ matches a single character.
Syntax:
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%substring%';

3. Subquery / Nested Query:
A query inside another query, useful for comparisons with aggregate results.
Syntax:
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column > (SELECT AVG(column2) FROM table WHERE condition);

4. OR and AND Operators (Filtering):
Combine multiple conditions; OR returns true if any condition is true, AND only if all are true.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;

5. Aggregate Functions:
Perform calculations on sets of rows:
AVG(column) → average
MIN(column) → minimum
MAX(column) → maximum
SUM(column) → total sum
Use with GROUP BY to aggregate per category.
Syntax:
SELECT column, AVG(column2), MIN(column2), MAX(column2), SUM(column2)
FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING AVG(column2) > value;

6. Filtering with WHERE / HAVING:
WHERE filters rows before aggregation.
HAVING filters groups after aggregation.
Syntax:
SELECT column, COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE condition GROUP BY column HAVING COUNT(*) > value;

7. JOIN Operation:
Combines data from multiple tables using a related column.
Syntax:
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column
WHERE condition;
-----------------------------

(
Explanation
COUNT DISTINCT finds total unique instructors for a semester.
LIKE searches for names containing a substring.
Subquery with AVG compares individual salaries against departmental averages
OR / AND filtering retrieves courses taught in multiple semesters or by multiple conditions.
Aggregate functions with GROUP BY and HAVING compute summaries like average, min, max, or sum per group.
This practical demonstrates aggregation, filtering, subqueries, substring search, and JOINs in MySQL, which are core operations for database querying and reporting.
