Question:
Collection schema (Perform on MySQL Terminal)
teaches(T_ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
student(S_ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred)
instructor(T_ID, name, dept_name, salary)
course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
i. Find the names of the instructor in the university who have taught the courses semester-wise.
ii. Create View on single table which retrieves student details.
iii. Rename the column of table student from dept_name to department_name.
iv. Delete student name whose department is NULL.

============ Execurion -
Step 1: Start MySQL Terminal
mysql -u root -p
sudo mysql

Step 2: Create Database and Use
CREATE DATABASE university;
USE university;

Step 3: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE teaches(
    T_ID INT,
    course_id INT,
    sec_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(10),
    year YEAR
);

CREATE TABLE student(
    S_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    tot_cred INT
);

CREATE TABLE instructor(
    T_ID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE course(
    course_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    credits INT
);

Step 4: Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES (101, 'Dr. Smith', 'CSE', 50000);
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES (102, 'Dr. John', 'IT', 45000);
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES (103, 'Dr. Mary', 'CSE', 40000);

INSERT INTO student VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'CSE', 120);
INSERT INTO student VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'IT', 100);
INSERT INTO student VALUES (3, 'Charlie', NULL, 80);

INSERT INTO teaches VALUES (101, 201, 1, 'Fall', 2023);
INSERT INTO teaches VALUES (102, 202, 1, 'Spring', 2023);
INSERT INTO teaches VALUES (103, 201, 2, 'Fall', 2023);

-- Insert multiple instructors
INSERT INTO instructor (T_ID, name, dept_name, salary) VALUES
(101, 'Dr. Smith', 'CSE', 50000),
(102, 'Dr. John', 'IT', 45000),
(103, 'Dr. Mary', 'CSE', 40000);

-- Insert multiple students
INSERT INTO student (S_ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'CSE', 120),
(2, 'Bob', 'IT', 100),
(3, 'Charlie', NULL, 80);

-- Insert multiple courses
INSERT INTO course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits) VALUES
(201, 'DBMS', 'CSE', 4),
(202, 'Networking', 'IT', 3),
(203, 'Algorithms', 'CSE', 4);

-- Insert multiple teaches records
INSERT INTO teaches (T_ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year) VALUES
(101, 201, 1, 'Fall', 2023),
(102, 202, 1, 'Spring', 2023),
(103, 201, 2, 'Fall', 2023);

Query Execution and Answers
i. Find names of instructors semester-wise
SELECT i.name, t.semester
FROM instructor i
JOIN teaches t ON i.T_ID = t.T_ID
ORDER BY t.semester;

ii. Create View on student table
CREATE VIEW student_view AS
SELECT * FROM student;
SELECT * FROM student_view;

iii. Rename column dept_name to department_name
ALTER TABLE student
CHANGE COLUMN dept_name department_name VARCHAR(50);
SELECT * FROM student;

iv. Delete student whose department is NULL
DELETE FROM student
WHERE department_name IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM student;

What is MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores structured data in tables and allows performing queries, updates, and transactions using SQL commands.

Practical Related Concepts
1. Views:
A view is a virtual table based on the result of a query.
It simplifies complex queries and provides controlled access to data.
Syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

2. JOINs:
Combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
Syntax:
SELECT columns FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

3. ALTER TABLE (Rename Column):
Used to modify table structure, such as renaming columns.
Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name datatype;

4. DELETE Statement:
Removes rows from a table based on a condition.
Syntax:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

5. ORDER BY Clause:
Sorts the query result based on one or more columns.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC|DESC;

6. NULL Handling:
SQL uses IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to filter records containing null values.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NULL;

(
Explanation
JOIN with instructor and teaches allows retrieving instructor names along with the semester they taught.
View creation (student_view) enables simplified access to student details without querying the table directly.
Column rename updates dept_name to department_name to make it more readable.
DELETE operation removes all records where department_name is NULL, maintaining data integrity.
ORDER BY ensures semester-wise organization, and proper JOIN ensures semester-specific retrieval.
This practical demonstrates table relationships, filtering, data modification, view creation, and handling NULL values effectively in MySQL.
