1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

These commands define the structure of the database.

-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;

-- Use the database
USE StudentDB;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    RollNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Course VARCHAR(30)
);

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE Student ADD Email VARCHAR(50);

-- Delete a column
ALTER TABLE Student DROP COLUMN Email;

-- Delete the table
-- DROP TABLE Student;

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

These commands are used to insert, update, delete, and view data.

-- Insert records
INSERT INTO Student (RollNo, Name, Age, Course)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 20, 'Computer Science');

INSERT INTO Student (RollNo, Name, Age, Course)
VALUES (2, 'Sneha', 21, 'Information Tech');

-- Retrieve data
SELECT * FROM Student;

-- Update record
UPDATE Student SET Age = 22 WHERE RollNo = 2;

-- Delete record
DELETE FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 1;



Theory: DDL and DML Commands in SQL

This program demonstrates the use of DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands in SQL.

1. DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of a database and its objects such as tables.
Common DDL commands include:

CREATE: Used to create a new database or table.

ALTER: Used to modify an existing table by adding or removing columns.

DROP: Used to delete a table or database permanently.

In this program, a database named StudentDB and a table Student are created. The ALTER TABLE command is used to add and drop the Email column.

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language):
DML commands are used to manage the data stored inside database tables.
Common DML commands include:

INSERT: Adds new records to a table.

SELECT: Retrieves data from a table.

UPDATE: Modifies existing records.

DELETE: Removes specific records from a table.

Here, student details are inserted, updated, and deleted from the Student table using DML commands.

This program shows how DDL defines the structure of the database, while DML operates on the data within that structure.
