Theory:

The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized single-board computer that supports a variety of operating systems. These operating systems are lightweight, optimized for ARM processors, and designed for educational, embedded, or IoT purposes.

Common Operating Systems for Raspberry Pi:

    1. Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian):

        - Official and most commonly used OS.

        - Based on Debian Linux.

        - Comes with programming tools (Python, Scratch, etc.) and a GUI.

    2. Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server:

        - Full-featured Linux distribution suitable for desktop and server use.

        - Popular for IoT and development projects.

    3. Kali Linux:

        - Designed for penetration testing and cybersecurity.

        - Used for ethical hacking and network analysis.

    4. LibreELEC / OSMC:

        - Media center OS for playing videos, music, and streaming.

        - Based on Kodi platform.

    5. Windows 10 IoT Core:

        - Lightweight version of Windows designed for embedded systems and IoT devices.

    6. RetroPie:

        - OS for retro gaming emulation.

        - Converts Raspberry Pi into a gaming console.

Process of OS Installation on Raspberry Pi:
Step 1: Download OS Image

    - Visit the official Raspberry Pi website:
    https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

    - Download the Raspberry Pi Imager tool.

Step 2: Prepare the SD Card

    - Insert a microSD card (8GB or larger) into your computer using a card reader.

    - Open Raspberry Pi Imager.

    - Select:

        + Choose OS: (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS)

        + Choose Storage: select your microSD card.

Step 3: Write OS to SD Card

    - Click Write to flash the OS image onto the SD card.

    - Wait for the process to complete.

    - Safely eject the SD card after flashing.

Step 4: Setup Raspberry Pi

    - Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

    - Connect:

        + Monitor (HDMI)

        + Keyboard and Mouse (USB)

        + Power supply (5V/2.5A)

        + Optional: Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle

Step 5: Boot and Configure

    - Power on the Raspberry Pi.

    - The system boots into the selected OS.

    - Complete the initial setup:

        + Set language and keyboard.

        + Configure Wi-Fi.

        + Update software if needed.
